\title{Grid generation parameters}
\arguments{
\item{grid}{Character argument specifying geometry of grid to generate.
Options include \code{"rect"} (the default) for rectangular grid, \code{"tri"} for
triangular grid, or \code{"hex"} for hexagonal grid.}

\item{n}{Either a single integer specifying grid resolution in both dimensions,
or a vector of length 2 specifying \code{c(nx, ny)} for separate x and y resolutions.
Default is \code{40}. Higher values create smoother surfaces but slower rendering.}

\item{direction}{Either \code{"x"} (the default) or \code{"y"}, specifying the orientation
of tile rows. Ignored for rectangular grids.}
}
\description{
Parameters defining the geometry, resolution, and orientation of a regular grid
of tiles, as used by various ggcube layer functions.
}
\details{
Grids are constructed such that tiles are approximately equilateral
when scaled to a square domain, unless \code{n} gives separate resolution values
for the two dimensions. For triangular and hexagonal grids, this means that
\code{n} is only approximate.
