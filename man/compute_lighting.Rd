\title{Apply lighting models to surface normals with positional light support}
\usage{
compute_lighting(normals, lighting = lighting(), face_centers = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{normals}{Matrix with 3 columns (x, y, z normal components), where each
row represents a face normal vector. Should be unit vectors (normalized).}

\item{lighting}{A lighting specification object created by \code{lighting()}}

\item{face_centers}{Matrix with 3 columns (x, y, z coordinates) representing
the center position of each face in data coordinate space. Required for
positional lighting, optional for directional lighting.}
}
\value{
Vector of lighting values. For most methods, returns numeric values.
For \code{method = "normal_rgb"}, returns hex color strings with \code{I()}
class for identity scaling.
}
\description{
Computes lighting values from surface normals using various lighting models.
Supports both directional lighting (parallel rays) and positional lighting
(point light sources with per-face light directions).
