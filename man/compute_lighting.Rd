\title{Apply lighting models to surface normals}
\usage{
compute_lighting(normals, lighting = lighting("lambert"))
}
\arguments{
\item{normals}{Matrix with 3 columns (x, y, z normal components), where each
row represents a face normal vector}

\item{lighting}{A lighting specification object created by \code{lighting()}}
}
\value{
Vector of lighting values (numeric for most methods, hex colors for normal_rgb)
}
\description{
Computes lighting values from surface normals using various lighting models.
This function is shared between stat_surface and stat_terrain to ensure
consistent lighting behavior.
