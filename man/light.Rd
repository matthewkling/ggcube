\usage{
light(
  method = "diffuse",
  direction = c(-0.5, 0, 1),
  anchor = "scene",
  position = NULL,
  distance_falloff = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{method}{Character string specifying lighting model:
\itemize{
\item \code{"diffuse"}: The default. Atmospheric lighting with soft shadows (only surfaces pointing
directly away from light source are fully dark; base color occurs on surfaces perpendicular to light)
\item \code{"direct"}: Direct lighting with hard shadows (all surfaces angled beyond 90 degrees from
light source are fully dark; base color occurs on surfaces angled 45 degrees toward light)
\item \code{"rgb"}: Map surface orientation to three dimensional color space. Rather than the light model
darkening or brightening base colors as in the other models, this model generates a wholly new set of
colors. If this option is selected, parameters like \code{mode} and \code{contrast} are ignored, but
\code{fill}, \code{color}, and \code{direction} still apply.
}}

\item{direction}{Numeric vector of length 3 specifying direction in 3D space (x, y, z) that
light comes from for directional lighting. Depending on \code{anchor}, direction is relative to
either the plot axes or the viewing pane. The default is \code{c(-.5, 0, 1)}, giving
diagonal lighting from the upper right edge with default rotation and anchor. At least
one value must be non-zero. Values are automatically normalized, so magnitude doesn't
matter, only sign and relative magnitude. Direction is specified in visual space (relative
to the rendered cube's bounding box), not data space. This argument is ignored if
\code{position} is provided.}

\item{anchor}{Character string specifying the reference frame for light direction:
\itemize{
\item \code{"scene"} (default): Light \code{direction} is fixed relative to the data/scene.
Light rotates with the plot, so regardless of rotation, \code{direction = c(1, 0, 0)}
lights surfaces facing the "xmax" cube face, for example.
\item \code{"camera"}: Light \code{direction} is fixed relative to the camera/viewer.
Light direction stays in place regardless of rotation, so \code{direction = c(1, 0, 0)}
lights surfaces facing the right side of the plot, for example.
}
When all rotation parameters are zero, these options give the same result.}

\item{position}{Numeric vector of length 3 specifying light source position in
data coordinate space for positional lighting. When specified, each face gets
its own light direction calculated from the light position to the face center.
Mutually exclusive with \code{direction}. Default is NULL (use directional lighting).}

\item{distance_falloff}{Logical indicating whether to apply distance-based
intensity falloff for positional lighting using inverse square law
(intensity ∝ 1/distance²). Only used when \code{position} is specified.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{fill}{Logical indicating whether to apply lighting to fill colors. Default is TRUE.}

\item{color}{Logical indicating whether to apply lighting to border/line colors. Default is TRUE.}

\item{mode}{Character string specifying color lighting mode:
\itemize{
\item \code{"hsv"}: The default. Modifies \emph{value} component of \emph{HSV} color
(fades to bright colors at high end, black at low end).
\item \code{"hsl"}: Modifies \emph{lightness} component of \emph{HSL} color
(fades to white at high end, black at low end).
}
These two options give identical results for grayscale colors.}

\item{contrast}{Numeric value greater than zero controlling the intensity of lighting effects.
1.0 (the default) gives full black-to-white range. Values less than 1 give subtler effects, while
values greater than 1 give more dramatic effects.}

\item{backface_scale, backface_offset}{Numeric values that determine how "frontface" light values get
modified (scaled and then offset) to derive "backface" light values. A backface is the side of a
polygon that faces the underside of a surface or the inside of a volume. Frontface light values are
typically in the range \verb{[-1, 1]} (unless \code{contrast} is boosted). The default scale of -1 gives
backfaces highly contrasting lighting to frontfaces. To light backfaces the same as frontfaces,
set scale to 1. To uniformly darken (brighten) all backfaces, use a negative (positive) offset.}
}
\value{
A \code{lighting} object that can be passed to polygon-based 3D layers or to \code{coord_3d()}.
}
\description{
Creates a lighting specification object for use with 3D polygon layers.
Lighting modifies the brightness of fill and/or base color aesthetics based on surface
orientation (i.e., it implements form shadows but not cast shadows).
Various options are available to control light qualities and light source location.
The result can be passed \code{coord_3d()} to for application to the whole plot, or to individual
\verb{geom_*_3d()} layer functions (which take precedence over plot-level lighting).
}
\details{
Note that light-like effects can also be achieved in some stats by mapping color
aesthestics to computed variables such as \code{after_stat(dzdx)}; see \code{\link[=geom_surface_3d]{geom_surface_3d()}}
for examples.
