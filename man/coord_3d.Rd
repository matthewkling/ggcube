coord_3d(
  pitch = 0,
  roll = -60,
  yaw = -30,
  persp = TRUE,
  dist = 2,
  expand = TRUE,
  clip = "off",
  panels = "background",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{roll, pitch, yaw}{Rotation around x, y, and z axes, respectively, in degrees.
Positive values rotate the near face of the plot "downward", "rightward", and clockwise, respectively.}

\item{persp}{Logical indicating whether to apply perspective projection. When \code{TRUE} (the default),
objects farther from the viewer appear smaller. When \code{FALSE}, produces an orthographic projection in which
lines that are parallel in 3D space render as parallel in the plot.}

\item{dist}{Distance from viewer to center of the data cube. Only used when \code{persp = TRUE}.
Larger values create less perspective distortion. Default is 2.
Values less than 1 are allowed but can be problematic for rendering.}

\item{expand}{Logical indicating whether to expand axis ranges beyond the data range,
similar to standard ggplot2 behavior. If \code{TRUE} (the default), expansion behavior
can be controlled using standard axis scaling functions, e.g.
\code{... + scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(.5))}.}

\item{clip}{Character string indicating clipping behavior. Use \code{"off"} (the default, recommended
for some 3D plots) to allow drawing outside the plot panel.}

\item{panels}{Character vector specifying which panels to render, including one or more of the following:
\itemize{
\item \code{"background"}, \code{"foreground"}: faces laying behind or in front of
the cube's interior volume, respectively. These panels vary depending on plot rotation.
\item \code{"xmin"}, \code{"ymax"}, etc.: names of specific cube faces.
\item \code{"all"}, \code{"none"}: display the full cube or remove all faces.
}
The default is \code{"background"}. Note that panel styling is handled
via the normal \code{theme()} approach; if you select panels that sit in front of
the data, you can control their transparency with \code{element_rect(alpha = ...)}.}

\item{xlabels, ylabels, zlabels}{Character strings or length-2 character vectors specifying
axis label (text and title) placement. Labels are placed inline with grid lines for
the selected panel face. For each axis, there are four potential panels where labels
could be placed, and two potential edges for each panel. Labels can only be placed on
visible faces (see \code{panels} argument). Each parameter accepts:
\itemize{
\item \code{"auto"} (default): Automatic edge selection based on an algorithm
that prioritizes edges that are visible on the periphery of the plot and considers
several attributes of face geometry for better readability.
\item \code{c("face1", "face2")}: Manual edge specification using two adjacent
face names (e.g., \code{c("xmin", "ymin")} selects the edge shared by the
xmin and ymin faces). The \strong{first face} in the vector determines which
face the axis labels will be aligned with, while the second face
identifies which edge of this face gets labelled. Available face names are:
"xmin", "xmax", "ymin", "ymax", "zmin", "zmax".
}}

\item{rotate_labels}{Logical indicating whether axis labels (text and titles) should automatically
rotate to align with the projected axis directions. When \code{FALSE}, uses theme
text and title angle settings.}

\item{scales}{Character string specifying aspect ratio behavior:
\itemize{
\item \code{"free"} (default): Each axis scales independently to fill cube space,
then \code{ratio} applies to standardized coordinates. This gives maximum
visual range for each dimension.
\item \code{"fixed"}: Maintains proportional relationships in raw data values,
as scaled by \code{ratio}. Similar to \code{coord_fixed()} but for 3D
(visual ratios match the labeled axis ranges).
}}

\item{ratio}{Numeric vector of length 3 specifying relative axis lengths as
\code{c(x, y, z)}. Defaults to \code{c(1, 1, 1)} for equal proportions.
\itemize{
\item With \code{scales = "free"}: Ratios apply to scaled cube coordinates
\item With \code{scales = "fixed"}: Ratios apply to original data coordinates
}}
}
\description{
\code{coord_3d} is a 3D coordinate system that creates a 2D view of 3D data.
This is the essential core component of any plot made with \code{ggcube}.
It supports rotation, perspective projection, and options for controlling plot
aspect ratios, panel selection, and axis label placement.
}
\section{3D Theming}{

3D plots support additional theme elements beyond standard ggplot2 themes:

\strong{Text elements:}
\itemize{
\item \code{axis.text.z}: Styling for z-axis tick labels (inherits from \code{axis.text})
\item \code{axis.title.z}: Styling for z-axis title (inherits from \code{axis.title})
\item \code{axis.text}, \code{axis.text}: Standard styling with \code{element_text()}. Note: use
\code{element_text(margin = margin(...))} to adjust text padding, with left/right
margins affecting axis text and top/bottom margins affecting axis titles;
since placement and justification of these elements varies dynamically,
no distinction is made between left and right margins, or between top and
bottom margins -- you can set either, and the maximum of the two will be used.
}

\strong{Panel elements:}
\itemize{
\item \code{panel.foreground}: Styling for cube faces rendered in front of data (inherits from \code{panel.background})
\item \code{panel.border.foreground}: Styling for cube faces rendered in front of data (inherits from \code{panel.border})
\item \code{panel.grid.foreground}: Styling for grid lines on foreground faces (inherits from \code{panel.grid})
\item \code{panel.grid.major.foreground}: Major grid lines on foreground faces (inherits from \code{panel.grid.foreground})
}

\strong{Enhanced elements:}
\itemize{
\item \code{element_rect()} supports an \code{alpha} parameter for transparency effects, particularly useful for \code{panel.foreground}
}

The \code{panels} parameter controls which cube faces are rendered, while \code{theme()} controls their visual styling.
Background panels use standard \code{panel.background}, \code{panel.border}, \code{panel.grid}, etc., while foreground panels
use the \verb{*.foreground} variants listed above. Since the foreground elements inherit from the standard background
and grid elements, you can use \code{panel.background}, etc. to style both background and foreground faces simultaneously.
