}
\arguments{
\item{roll, pitch, yaw}{Rotation around x, y, and z axes, respectively, in degrees.
Positive values rotate the near face of the plot "downward", "rightward", and clockwise, respectively.}

\item{persp}{Logical indicating whether to apply perspective projection. When \code{TRUE} (the default),
objects farther from the viewer appear smaller. When \code{FALSE}, produces an orthographic projection in which
lines that are parallel in 3D space render as parallel in the plot.}

\item{dist}{Distance from viewer to center of the data cube. Only used when \code{persp = TRUE}.
Larger values create less perspective distortion. Default is 2.
Values less than 1 are allowed but can be problematic for rendering.}

\item{expand}{Logical indicating whether to expand axis ranges beyond the data range,
similar to standard ggplot2 behavior. If \code{TRUE} (the default), expansion behavior
can be controlled using standard axis scaling functions, e.g.
\code{... + scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(.5))}.}

\item{clip}{Character string indicating clipping behavior. Use \code{"off"} (the default, recommended
for some 3D plots) to allow drawing outside the plot panel.}

\item{panels}{Character vector specifying which panels to render, including one or more of the following:
\itemize{
\item \code{"background"} (the default), \code{"foreground"}: faces laying behind or in front of
the cube's interior volume, respectively. These panels vary depending on plot rotation.
\item \code{"xmin"}, \code{"ymax"}, etc.: names of specific cube faces.
\item \code{"all"}, \code{"none"}: display the full cube or remove all faces.
}
See \link{cube_theming} for details on panel styling, including transparency of foreground panels.}

\item{xlabels, ylabels, zlabels}{Character strings or length-2 character vectors specifying
axis label (text and title) placement. Labels are placed inline with grid lines for
the selected panel face. For each axis, there are four potential panels where labels
could be placed, and two potential edges for each panel. Labels can only be placed on
visible faces (see \code{panels} argument). Each parameter accepts:
\itemize{
\item \code{"auto"} (default): Automatic edge selection based on an algorithm
that prioritizes edges that are visible on the periphery of the plot and considers
several attributes of face geometry for better readability.
\item \code{c("face1", "face2")}: Manual edge specification using two adjacent
face names (e.g., \code{c("xmin", "ymin")} selects the edge shared by the
xmin and ymin faces). The \strong{first face} in the vector determines which
face the axis labels will be aligned with, while the second face
identifies which edge of this face gets labelled. Available face names are:
"xmin", "xmax", "ymin", "ymax", "zmin", "zmax".
}
See \link{cube_theming} for details on axis label styling.}

\item{rotate_labels}{Logical indicating whether axis labels (text and titles) should automatically
rotate to align with the projected axis directions. When \code{FALSE}, uses theme
text and title angle settings.}

\item{scales}{Character string specifying aspect ratio behavior:
\itemize{
\item \code{"free"} (default): Each axis scales independently to fill cube space,
then \code{ratio} applies to standardized coordinates. This gives maximum
visual range for each dimension.
\item \code{"fixed"}: Maintains proportional relationships in raw data values,
as scaled by \code{ratio}. Similar to \code{coord_fixed()} but for 3D
(visual ratios match the labeled axis ranges).
}}

\item{ratio}{Numeric vector of length 3 specifying relative axis lengths as
\code{c(x, y, z)}. Defaults to \code{c(1, 1, 1)} for equal proportions.
\itemize{
\item With \code{scales = "free"}: Ratios apply to scaled cube coordinates
\item With \code{scales = "fixed"}: Ratios apply to original data coordinates
}}

\item{zoom}{Numeric value controlling the framing of the plot. Values greater
than 1 zoom in (tighter framing, may crop edges), values less than 1
zoom out (more whitespace around the plot). Default is 1.}

\item{light}{A lighting specification object created by \code{\link[=light]{light()}},\code{"none"} to disable
lighting, or \code{NULL} to inherit plot-level lighting specs from the coord. Specify
plot-level lighting in \code{coord_3d()} and layer-specific lighting in \verb{geom_*3d()}
functions.}
}
\value{
A \code{Coord} object that can be added to a ggplot.
}
\description{
\code{coord_3d} is a 3D coordinate system that creates a 2D view of 3D data.
This is the essential core component of any plot made with \code{ggcube}.
It supports rotation, perspective projection, and options for controlling plot
aspect ratios, panel selection, axis label placement, and lighting.

# Use `pitch`, `roll`, `yaw` to control plot rotation ----------------------

# zero rotation gives view from x-y face
p + coord_3d(pitch = 0, roll = 0, yaw = 0)

# pitch rotates plot around y axis
p + coord_3d(pitch = 30, roll = 0, yaw = 0)

# roll rotates plot around x axis
p + coord_3d(pitch = 0, roll = 30, yaw = 0)

# yaw rotates plot around z axis
p + coord_3d(pitch = 0, roll = 0, yaw = 30)

# combine them to achieve arbitrary rotations
p + coord_3d(pitch = 20, roll = 40, yaw = 60)


# Use `persp` and `dist` to control perspective effects --------------------

# strong perspective effect as if seen from very close
p + coord_3d(dist = 1)

# weaker perspective effects as if seen from far away
p + coord_3d(dist = 3)

# orthographic projection (`dist = Inf` would be equivalent but it errors)
p + coord_3d(persp = FALSE)


# Use `scales` and `ratio` to control aspect ratio -------------------------

# The default "free" scales shown above give cube with maximum visual range.
# Use "fixed" scales to make figure match data scales, like coord_fixed.
p + coord_3d(scales = "fixed")

# Custom aspect ratios: make y twice as long visually

# Combine behaviors: fix scales and make y twice as long
p + coord_3d(scales = "fixed", ratio = c(1, 2, 1))


# Use `panels` to select which cube faces to render ------------------------

p + coord_3d(panels = c("xmin", "xmax", "zmax"))

# foreground panels default to 20\% opaque (can be styled using `theme()`)
p + coord_3d(panels = "all")


# Use label params to control axis text placement and rotation -------------

p + coord_3d(xlabels = c("ymax", "zmax"),
             zlabels = c("xmax", "ymin"))
