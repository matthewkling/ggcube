# ggcube (development version)

* Lighting can now be set for a whole plot by adding `light()` to it, e.g. `ggplot(...) + coord_3d() + light(direction = c(1, 0, 0))`. This is the recommended way to specify plot-level lighting, and works regardless of where it appears in the plot expression. The `light` argument of `coord_3d()` continues to work; supplying both is an error.
* `light("none")` is a new way to disable lighting, equivalent to the string `"none"` accepted by `light` arguments.
* `geom_hull_3d()`'s `"alpha"` method got some bug fixes related to face orientation and the `radius` parameter.

# ggcube 0.2.0

* The new `orbit_3d()` function builds HTML widgets that let you interactively rotate ggcube plots.
* Plotmath is now supported in axis text and titles; e.g., `xlab(expression(italic(alpha[1])))` now behaves as expected.
* Fixed several bugs, including issues with `element_rect()`, `guide_legend_3d()`, and camera-anchored lighting.

# ggcube 0.1.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
